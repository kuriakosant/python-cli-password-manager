GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3.0
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) [2024] [KYRIAKOS ANTONIADIS]
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share the software and to change it. By doing this we encourage
developers to improve the program for all users. However, our
license is not designed to permit you to put the software in proprietary
software. If you distribute copies of such a program, whether modified
or unmodified, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients of
the program. That is, you must distribute the source code or make it
available, and you must keep the GPL license intact.

                             TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
   The "Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
   and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
   this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
   recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
   you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
   that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
   or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
   to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
   terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
   run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
   in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including
   an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
   (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
   redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
   how to get the source code. (Exception: if the Program is
   interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your
   modified version may omit it, but you must still make it possible for
   the user to get the source code.)

3. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
   as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to
   copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is void, and will
   automatically terminate your rights under this License.

4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
   the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
   law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
   distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
   indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
   and conditions for copying, distributing, or modifying the Program or
   works based on it.

5. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, or modify the Program subject
   to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
   this License.

6. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement, or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

7. Each licensee is responsible for ensuring that their use of the Program
   complies with all applicable laws, including but not limited to
   copyright, patent, and trademark laws.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a
   distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain
   numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it,
   you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
   numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this
   License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

11. NO WARRANTY

    11.1 Because the Program is licensed free of charge, there is no
    warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
    Except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holders and/or
    other parties provide the Program "as is" without warranty of any
    kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
    implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
    purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
    Program is with you. Should the Program prove defective, you assume
    the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

    11.2 In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
    writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify
    and redistribute the Program as permitted above, be liable to you for
    damages, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential
    damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Program
    (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered
    inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of
    the Program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder
    or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

12. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
